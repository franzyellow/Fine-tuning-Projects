## Model Access

The fine-tuned model **`llama3.1_8B_pricer-2025-10-22_00.05.08`** is publicly available on the [my Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/franzyellow/llama3.1_8B_pricer-2025-10-22_00.05.08).

This checkpoint is fine-tuned from **Llama 3.1 8B** for **price prediction tasks** using supervised fine-tuning.  
It includes the final adapter weights (`adapter_model.safetensors`) and tokenizer configuration.

Based on the learning from the Udemy course [LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/?couponCode=LLM_SEPTEMBER)
